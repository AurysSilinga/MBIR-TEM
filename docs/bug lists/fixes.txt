Installation:
+installed hyperspy with bundle install
+mayavi and vtk needed to be newest version
+used "mamba env update --name test1 --file local.yml" to install pyramid, and then "python setup.py install" in pyramid-master directory


Known problems:
+Example quiver plot has "dirt" under the scalebar
+Quiver plot arrorw spacing deforms the whole image
+Creating a slab of width 3 creates one that is width 4 (indexing bug)
+data.plot_phasemaps() has wrong labels. "phi and theta" are actually z_rotation and x_tilt
+Need to optimise the projector creator
+phasemapper kernel creator always becomes float64 which causes memory overloads for large simulations (need to allow type(field.a) == float32)
+Why does the averaging kernel A not sum to 1? Even if starting with mag_0=0
+enable skimage intelex
+use the distributed forward model class for calculations

fix list:
#projector.py changed rot-tilt projector to make equivalence radius a variable, and default for all projectors at 0.5
#fielddata.py changed all oa.marker.set_viewport(x) to oa.marker.viewport=x .
#dataset.py In set_3d_mask removed check if only one mask because it was bugged and gave wrong dimesions.
