1. Set up a Python package manager. 
   Install Miniforge that comes with a fresh installation of Python (for coding) and Mamba (for managing python packages).
   Follow the installation instructions on the Miniforge website (https://conda-forge.org/miniforge).
   This was last tested with Miniforge 3-24.3.0-0 release for Windows x86_64.
2. Open the Miniforge Command Prompt (usually has a start menu shortcut) and navigate to the pyramid-by-AS folder where this text file is located.
   On Windowns navigate using 'cd folder_name' commands
3. In Miniforge Prompt run the command 'mamba env create --file environment.yml' 
   This will downlaod and install the necessary Python packages for pyramidas to work.
4. Extract the jutil-master.zip and navigate to the folder with the command 'cd jutil-master'
5. Run the command 'python setup.py install'
   This will install the Jutil package that is not available online for automatic download.
6. Return to the pyramidas-by-AS folder with the command 'cd ..'
7. Run the command 'python setup.py install'
   Now that all the prerequisite packages are installed, this will install pyramidas itself.
8. Navigate to tests folder with command 'cd' test
9. Run the command 'python -m unittest'
   This will run all the tests and report if pyramidas was installed correctly. If something is wrong, an error will be shown.
   If installation was successful, deprecation warnings are expected, but at the end it should display 'errors=0'.
