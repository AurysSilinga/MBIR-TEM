# Create environment with "conda env create", update with "conda env update"!
# This file contains the top level dependencies of the pyramid project!
# requirements.txt also contains sub-dependencies, generated by "pip freeze > requirements.txt"!
# Add new dependencies here, then "conda env update", then "pip freeze > requirements.txt"!
# To see if compatible upgrades are available for the current packages, use "conda upgrade --all"!
# When packages are deprecated/deleted, it may be best to recreate the environment from scratch!
