# Environment specification for MBIR-TEM
# Sets up the environment for manually installing pyramidas and Juti.
# Create environment with "mamba env create", update with "mamba env update"!
# This file contains the top level dependencies of the pyramid project!
# pip_requirements.txt also contains sub-dependencies, generated by "pip freeze > requirements.txt"!
# Add new dependencies here, then "mamba env update", then "pip freeze > requirements.txt"!
# To see if compatible upgrades are available for the current packages, use "mamba upgrade --all"!
# When packages are deprecated/deleted, it may be best to recreate the environment from scratch!
